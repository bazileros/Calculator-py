## Overview

This is a simple scientific calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python and Tkinter. The calculator provides basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, and square root functionality.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, and tangent.
- Square root functionality.
- Clear button to reset the input.
- Supports both button clicks and keyboard input.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the `calculator.py` file.
2. Make sure you have Python and Tkinter installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `calculator.py`.
4. Run the calculator by executing the following command:

python calculator.py
```

5. The GUI for the calculator will open, and you can start using it to perform calculations.

## Usage

1. Numeric Input: Click on the calculator buttons to input numbers.
2. Operation Buttons: Click on the buttons for basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), and square root (sqrt).
3. Equals (=) Button: Click the equals button to evaluate the entered expression.
4. Clear (C) Button: Click the clear button to reset the input field.
5. Keyboard Support: You can also use the keyboard for numeric input and some basic operations.

## Customize the Calculator

This calculator is meant to serve as a basic example. You can customize and extend it in various ways, such as:

- Adding more scientific functions (e.g., logarithms, exponential).
- Improving the GUI layout and design.
- Adding support for more advanced operations.
- Implementing error handling to provide better user feedback.

Feel free to experiment and enhance the calculator according to your needs.
